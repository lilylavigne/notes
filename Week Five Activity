Writing about waves against sailboat.

Narrative:

I used to live on a sailboat. The earliest memory I can remember was when I was three or four years old. I woke up from my deep sleep to the sound of waves crashing against the sides on the boat. I try to go back to sleep; I pass out for about five minutes until I hear the waves striking against the boat again. Startled, I can not sleep. I am scared, I feel like a robber is intruding my house. I want them to leave, but they will not, just like the waves. I want it to stop but it I do not know how long the storm will last. I start to hear thunder, it is so loud and so is the wind. Is the wind going to knock our boat over? I can hear the wind blowing through our sails and lines that are tied up on the top deck. The wind sounds like high-pitched whistles and some of our things on the deck are rustling around. I do not know how my family is not awake right now to come and save me. I go to wake my brother up who is beside me but he is only one year older and is sound asleep. I tap him slightly, no movement. I tap him again a tiny bit harder, no movement again. This time I shake him and he moves a little. I feel some type of hope that he will wake up but instead he nudges me away. I do not want to wake my parents up but I feel like I have no choice. I go to my parents room and they tell me that everything is okay and put me back to bed. Being a little kid, things like waves hitting the boat are a big deal. It seems like the world is about to end.
