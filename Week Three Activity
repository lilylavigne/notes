Notes:

I asked my friend who is a dancer to do my three movements.
She decided to do a few movements from three different genres of dance.
1. Ballet
- Pointe work(movement of the feet/dancing on toes)
- graceful arm movements 
2. Tap dance (movement on the feet, tappnig the floor with special shoes)
3. Hip-hop (pop-lock movement)

Reminded myself when I was a figure skater. 
Since I was little till high school.

Narrative:

Figure skating is dear to my heart. In grade five, my mother put me in figure skating and 
my brother in ice hockey. It led to years of vigorous training, practices, annual shows, off ice acrobatics practice and competitions. 
After school, I walked home and got ready to go to practice. To prepare myself, I would gather my ice skates in a small duffle bag, cold water for hydration,
thin black gloves, skincoloured stockings and my skating dress and off I went to practice. When I walk into practice, there is a nostolgic smell of the ice arena and the popcorn they used to sell at the concession stand. 
I would give my skates to a guy to sharpen them and then I would walk to the skaters room to put them on. My skating blades were so sharp
