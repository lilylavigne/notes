Notes:

The three images my partner picked:

1. Hiking Garibaldi
2. Moving from Sechelt to Vancouver
3. Our last family camping trip

Between the images that my partner picked, I was torn between 1. and 2.
I have decided to write about number 2.

Narrative:

It was the last day of summer. I woke up early in the morning, opened the curtains and noticed the sun shining brightly. I heard my father moving things around, I went downstairs to the kitchen to check out what the noise was. He was putting things into boxes and abruptly told me that we were moving. It felt like smoke rapidly clouded my head. I could not fathom what he was saying nor did I know what to do. My dad said we are catching the ferry in four hours. I have a flashback to when I heard my family talking about moving earlier this summer but I did not think we were going to move this fast. Thoughts running through my head, the first thought was, "what about all of my frineds?" I ran to my room, I started packing my things and did not have much time to think. I was the last one in the house, I walked around the house to make sure I didn't forget anything. I gently closed the front door and locked it. I jumped in the back of our truck carrying my last few items, gave my old house one last look, said my farewells and off we drove.
