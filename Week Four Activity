Narrative: 

If a fire were to spread through my home, there would be one certain object that I would not be able leave behind. It is not
something you'd expect.

I gaze at her pink-beige coloured face, it is beaten up from over the years and has a small stain of clear nail polish on it from when I was younger. Her blonde, pig tailed hair is now scruffy and is not as it used to be. There are slight strands that stick out from her used to-be tightly braided hair. I try to push the yellow, soft, strands back into her braids but it won't fit anymore. Her dress and hat match, the design is white with purple accents and small purple flowers everywhere. Her big, light, brown eyes still have the sparkle they used to when she would listen to all of the stories I would tell her.

We go to bed together, brush our teeth, say goodmorning, godnight, talk, eat and play. She is my bestfriend. She has been in the wash a countless amount of times and sits on the left side of my bed. Although I am not a little kid anymore, my doll has stuck by my side through everything.
