Notes:

I asked my friend who is a dancer to do my three movements.
She decided to do a few movements from three different genres of dance.
1. Ballet
- Pointe work(movement of the feet/dancing on toes)
- graceful arm movements 
2. Tap dance (movement on the feet, tappnig the floor with special shoes)
3. Hip-hop (pop-lock movement)

Reminded myself when I was a figure skater. 
Since I was little till high school.

Narrative:

Figure skating is dear to my heart. In grade five, my mother put me in figure skating and 
my brother in ice hockey. It led to years of vigorous training, practices, annual shows, off ice acrobatics practice and competitions. 
When I would prepare myself for practice at home
