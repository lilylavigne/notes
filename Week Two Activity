How planets and the universe were created.

Narrative:

In comosology, the Big Bang theory magically created our superforce from neutrons, protons and electrons which includes the universe, stars and galaxies. What crazy Scientists came up with that? Have you ever head of the riddle, "hey, diddle, diddle?" Where there was a cat, fiddle, cow, moon, dog, dish and a spoon. That's just it. These key objects are significantlly intertwined and there is a reason why there is a riddle about it. They are what atually created the universe. Before the Big Bang theory and all of those weird theories, there were three planets, the moon, sun and earth. The earth had human figures, agriculture and was modern for its time. Elias is the goddess of the moon, she controlled fate and that led the moon to shine bright daily. 
Elias had three daughts, named cat, cow and dog of the moon. Cat would play the fiddle and her music made objects dance. She would sit in her room all day long, creating masterpieces. These symphonies were created for her mother, Elias to use. Cow was the middle sister and danced to her older sister, Cat's melodies. Cow's dances would bring objects togethers no matter how far apart they were. She would jump and prance all over the moon until she was tired. Dog was the youngest and goofiest, she would laugh. Her laughs were so loud, it was almost like a lion roar. When she laughed, objects would create into whatever she wanted. If she wanted to drink milk, she would laugh and milk was right in the palm of her hands.
