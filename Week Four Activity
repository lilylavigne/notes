If a fire were to spread through my  home, there would be a certain item that i wouldn't want to leave behind. It's not
something youd expect: a blonde haired, pig tailed, purple and white dress stuffed animal name Dolly.
Although i'm not a little kid anymore, this doll has been with me since birth, and has helped me through the toughest of 
situations. it's like owning a pet for example, a dog, who is silent, but sits there and listens to all your problems 
as you vent out to him/her.
