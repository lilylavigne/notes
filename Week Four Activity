Narrative: 
If a fire were to spread through my home, there would be a certain object that I would not be able leave behind. It is not
something you'd expect.

I gaze at her pink-beige coloured face, it is a beat beaten up from over the years and has a small stain of clear nail polish on it from when I was younger. Her blonde, pig tailed hair is scruffy now and not as it used to be. There are slight strands that stick out from her used to be tightly braided hair. I try to push the strands back into her braids but it won't fit anymore. Dolly's dress and hat match, it's design is white, purple accents and small purple flowers everywhere. 

She has been in the wash a countless amount of times. 

purple and white dress stuffed animal name Dolly.
Although I am not a little kid anymore, this doll has been with me since birth, and has helped me through the toughest of 
situations. it is like owning a pet for example, a dog, who is silent, but sits there and listens to all your problems 
as you vent out to him/her.

I carry her with me wherever I go,
