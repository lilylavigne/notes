Notes:

The three images my partner picked:

1. Hiking Garibaldi
2. Moving from Sechelt to Vancouver
3. Our last family camping trip

Between the images that my partner picked, I was torn between 1. and 2.
I have decided to write about number 2.

Narrative:

It was the last day of summer. I woke up early in the morning, opened the curtains and noticed the sun shining through I heard my father moving things around
