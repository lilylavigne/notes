Notes:

- my partner gathers a couple of objects 

Object #1 - specialty bun from t&t

- hear crinkle noises
- the centre is squishy
- plastic is a square shape
- I can smell bread
- I know what it is

I closed my eyes, I first felt the object in my hand and immediately heard the plastic wrapper that sounded like little crinkle noises. I pressed down lightly on the object and felt that it was squishy and the shape was round. I knew what it was. It was a specialty bun.

It suddenly made me remember all of the times my family would simply walk to go grocery shopping when I was younger and get these buns.
I could picture us searching through the bakery section and picking out which buns I wanted. The smell of teh freshly baked bread and desserts floated in my head and a particular memory of one of my favourite custard buns. I also remember one of the first buns I have ever had were beef/pork buns and that I haven't had them in awhile. Now a days I usually end up getting a sweet bun instead of savoury. 

I felt happy that my partner gave me this object, it gave me many happy feelings of the past of my childhood.


Object #2 - mini snowglobe

- it's round
- very hard unlike my first object
- bottom feels square
- shake it, feels like there is water but can't tell 
- try to open it and seperate the round part from the base
- couldn't tell what this was first

When I first felt it, it was hard to distinguish what it was.. but then when I got it. I had to play a bit of a guessing game within myself. When I figured out it was a snowglobe, my mind easy travelled to vacations when I was younger because I collected a few snowglobes from various places. 

I remember wondering what it was like to be in a snowglobe.
- It reminded me of a TV show and a character named Sandy from spongebob squarepants, because she lives in a globe under water.

The globe also brought many memories of a childhood music box that had a ballerina in it. I got it from my mother and kept all my most prized jewerly in there. Even my little kid cheap plastic jewerly pieces.

I keep feeling more thankful for my life.







Reflections:
- This gives us the chance to write about something we normally wouldn't write about
- having to close our eyes is an interesting exercise and lets us use our touching/feeling sense
- lets us be descriptive more about an object
- can evoke different emotions, memories, imagery
- It gives more meanings to objects, rather than just something simple or don't care about.
- each exercse is bringing back so many memories, I can't help but feel grateful for my life and the things I have experienced while growing up.
