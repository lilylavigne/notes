Reflections:

While thinking about what to write about... the 5 senses runs through my mind. What also runs through my mind, is how taste and smell change when people age.
- Having a different look on senses and being more aware of them is interesting and a good way to appreciate senses more.
- Writing about senses can pull you into a setting/scene more.
- I think smelling is easier to write about...
- Seeing, touching are often a lot more used in writing, where as smell and taste aren't used as muhc as they could be. 
- Smells evoke a lot of memories
