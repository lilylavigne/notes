Notes:

I asked my friend who is a dancer to do my three movements.
She decided to do a few movements from three different genres of dance.
1. Ballet
- Pointe work(movement of the feet/dancing on toes)
- graceful arm movements 
2. Tap dance (movement on the feet, tappnig the floor with special shoes)
3. Hip-hop (pop-lock movement)

Reminded myself when I was a figure skater. 
Since I was little till high school.
