Notes:
Go outside at dawn and go for a walk to the park (Wednesday Morning, 6:30 am) Waking up/leaving my house:



Narrative:
I hear birds chirping I opened my blinds, the light from the sky slowly peaked throug When I woke up, my family was awake getting ready for work There are many cars on the road (going to work) There are a few people walking on the sidewalks The sidewalk has many cracks I can smell gasoline fumes

During the walk: I notice the sky is not sunny, nor cloudy just blue The air is so cold/crisp that I feel like it's hitting me in the face to wake up The air smells fresh I gaze at the park, I wonder which way I should walk first No one is here The grass/playground has dew on it I can see a squirrel hurrying along a tree near the dog park It is fairly quiet, except the sound of an occasional bird chirps I see a dog chasing a ball in the distance and its owner I can hear the loud dog parking



Reflections: 
I feel calm but awake from the fresh air. Thoughts: I think to myself that I should go on more early morning walks before I start my day... This was a great activity for disrupting my regular routine. Reactions: I am reacting this way because it's different from my usual routine and it feels good to get out for some exercise/air. My thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me that I will try to continue this at least twice a week.
