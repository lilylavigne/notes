One of my partners favourite memory is about skiing in Whistler.


Narrative:

The best season in Vancouver, British Columbia is Winter. It is my favourite time of the year because of the beautiful white snow. While growing up, my parents would take my brother, sister and myself skiing in Whistler, known as one of the largest ski resorts in North America. It is winter break and my family is renting a cabin for two weeks. Every winter we like to have a white Christmas and that is why we spend it in our favourite cabin here. The drive is about two hours which is not very long compared to other road trips, but is always a memorable ride because of the games we play and Christmas music we listen to. After the drive, I get out of the car and smell the clean snowy air. My siblings and I quickly rush to the bedrooms that we have been sleeping in since we were four years old. I set my things down, lay on my bed in peace, gaze at the ceiling and notice that the cabin still smells like an oak tree or smokey wood.

We wake up early, have breakfast and get ready for our first ski day of the year. I put my cozy sweat pants and long-sleeve shirt on then vest, puffy red jacket and black snow pants over top. I slip my socks, ski boots, gloves and toque on and off through the door I go. My family follows close behind but I can barley wait because I am so excited. We start on the bunny hill just to get used to the feeling of skiing again and I glide through the untouched, fresh, fluffy snow like I haven't been away from it for even a minute.

It is already 6:00 o'clock; skiing days past by quickly. I cannot wait to drink warm, homemade hot chocolate from my mother and have the gooey marshmellows melt in my mouth. The most memorable childhood memories are from this place.


Relfections:

- This exercise was nice to hear from someone else's memories. I love hearing people's stories and experiences. Fortunately I was able to relate to parts of it because of my skiing/snowboarding experiences when I was a kid as well.

- It brought my skiing memories to my mind and the few times I stayed in a cabin with my cousins and how joyable/fun it was.

- This exercise explored my learning from listening to someone else speak and being able to re-write one of their stories. It was a little challenging trying to explain in first person on their memory.

- Their story had to process through my brain and try to carify what they did.

- In elementry school, we would write journals daily. Being in this class makes me miss elementry school and writing in first person. I wish more classes had this opportunity.
