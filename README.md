# notes - Creative Activity for Week One – disrupting routines 

Go outside at dawn and go for a walk to the park (Wednesday Morning, 6:30 am) 
Waking up/leaving my house:

I hear birds chirping 
I opened my blinds, the light from the sky slowly peaked throug 
When I woke up, my family was awake getting ready for work 
There are many cars on the road (going to work) 
There are a few people walking on the sidewalks 
The sidewalk has many cracks 
I can smell gasoline fumes 

During the walk:
I notice the sky is not sunny, nor cloudy just blue 
The air is so cold/crisp that I feel like it's hitting me in the face to wake up 
The air smells fresh 
I gaze at the park, I wonder which way I should walk first 
No one is here 
The grass/playground has dew on it 
I can see a squirrel hurrying along a tree near the dog park 
It is fairly quiet, except the sound of an occasional bird chirps 
I see a dog chasing a ball in the distance and its owner 
I can hear the loud dog parking 
 
Feelings: I feel calm but awake from the fresh air. 
Thoughts: I think to myself that I should go on more early morning walks before I start my day... This was a great activity for disrupting my regular routine. 
Reactions: I am reacting this way because it's different from my usual routine and it feels good to get out for some exercise/air. 
My thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me that I will try to continue this at least twice a week.
