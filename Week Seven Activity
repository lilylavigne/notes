Topic: Picnic

Narrative:

I roll my neck left to right, slowly opening my eye lids and stretch both of my arms diagonally in the air. I remove my warm fleece blanket off of my body and crawl out of bed like a zombie. It is the long weekend! Today my family planned to have a picnic for Canada Day. 
We arrive at Stanley Park and in excitement I jump out of the car to help carry the picnic basket, umbrella, chairs and games. Immediately the air smells refreshing. I put down the picnic blanket, flop my sandals off and swiftly sit down on the blanket. There is nothing better than having a picnic with my loved-ones on a delightful sunny day. The smell of freshly cut grass and slight hint of the salty sea trace through the air from the breeze. 

It is about 11:00 am now, the sun is starting to get hotter. I take out the sunscreen to protect my skin from the harmful UV-rays, take the cap off and scents of coconut and aloe gust through the air. I help put it on my little brothers back as my family starts to get ready to eat. My father's specialty is grilling and barbecquing, he takes out his mini-grill and uses a lighter with the gasoline. After the skewers were done cooking. It was time to eat. My mother prepared 4 different types of sandwiches, fruit with a cheese and cracker platter. 

However, I was most excited to bite into the egg salad that my aunt always makes. I close my eyes with anticipation of the richness from the eggs, avocado, mayonnaise and mustard. It is delicious! My mouth is watering from the savory flavour from the spices of paprika, salt and pepper, the crunch of celery and the tanginess from quick squeeze of lemon on top. My families food is comforting and I cannot wait for dessert next.




Reflections:

While thinking about what to write about... the 5 senses runs through my mind. What also runs through my mind, is how taste and smell change when people age.
- Having a different look on senses and being more aware of them is interesting and a good way to appreciate senses more.
- Writing about senses can pull you into a setting/scene more.
- I think smelling is easier to write about...
- Seeing, touching, hearing are often a lot more used in writing, where as smell and taste aren't used as muhc as they could be. 
- Smells evoke a lot of memories

I picture myself without being able to smell or taste, nothing would be the same and things would not be as enjoyable. We take our senses for granted. Food, nature, odors would never be the same. We would not be able to distinguish sweet, salty, sour or bitter.

I really enjoyed this exercise and hope to incorporate these two senses more into my writing for the future.
